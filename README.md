📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my Round 2 Take-Home Assignment for the Data Analyst role at AxionRay. The assignment focuses on data validation, cleaning, tagging, feature extraction, visualization, and deriving actionable insights.

I have worked meticulously and sincerely to provide a well-structured and insightful analysis.

📂 Repository Structure

📁 Task 1 - Data Tagging

✅ DA - Task 1.xlsx – The dataset with tagged values based on the given taxonomy.

✅ Task 1 Summary Report.pdf – A detailed report explaining the tagging approach and key insights.


📁 Task 2 - Data Analysis & Insights

✅ Cleaned_Task_2.xlsx – The cleaned dataset with missing values handled and formatted correctly.

✅ Task2_Analysis.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with complete EDA, feature extraction, visualizations, and insights.

✅ Task2_Report.pdf – A structured 2-page report covering analysis, cleaning, visualizations, and recommendations.


📁 Bonus

✅ Visualization_Image.png – A creative & interactive visualization that highlights key findings.



📊 Key Insights & Takeaways

Task 1 (Data Tagging)

Categorized free-text complaints, causes, and corrections into structured taxonomy fields.
Identified top failure reasons: Loose connections, sensor malfunctions, and missing components.
Insights suggest improvements in manufacturing QC and predictive maintenance strategies.

Task 2 (Data Cleaning & Analysis)

Handled missing values, formatted date fields, and removed outliers.
Identified top failure trends using NLP-based feature extraction.
Visualized repair costs, failure distribution, and high-impact components.
Suggested AI-driven predictive maintenance and supplier quality improvements.

🔹 How to Run the Jupyter Notebook (Task2_Analysis.ipynb)

1️⃣ Clone this repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AxionRay-Data-Analysis-Assessment.git

2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder:

cd AxionRay-Data-Analysis-Assessment

3️⃣ Install required dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl

4️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

5️⃣ Run Task2_Analysis.ipynb to explore the data, visualizations, and insights.

💡 Recommendations for AxionRay

✅ Implement Predictive Maintenance – Use historical failure trends to detect at-risk components before failure occurs.

✅ Supplier Quality Control – Address frequent part failures through better vendor oversight and material testing.

✅ Cost Optimization – High-repair-cost components should be investigated for design improvements or alternative parts.

✅ AI-Based Fault Detection – Automate complaint analysis using NLP to enhance diagnostics and reduce resolution time.
